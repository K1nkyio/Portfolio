  tagline: 'Full-Stack Developer & ML Enthusiast',
  heroIntroduction: 'Building practical, scalable digital solutions that solve real-world problems.',
  aboutWork: `Nicholas Mureithi is a full-stack software developer and machine learning enthusiast focused on building practical, scalable digital solutions. His work spans mobile applications, web platforms, and AI-driven systems, with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, usability, and real-world impact.

He has developed full products end-to-end — from interface design to backend infrastructure and intelligent automation — consistently delivering tools that solve actual student, business, and productivity problems.

Nicholas specializes in modern stacks including React, Node.js, Next.js, Kotlin, Python, and NLP frameworks, and he approaches every project with a balance of engineering discipline, product thinking, and user-centered design.`,
  journey: `I got into software engineering out of curiosity, but it quickly turned into a drive to build tools that actually solve problems. Over time, I found myself drawn to full-stack development and machine learning because they allow me to create complete, end-to-end solutions — from the interface people see to the intelligent systems running in the background.`,
  howIWork: `I approach projects by breaking ideas down, validating fast, and shipping consistently. I value clean architecture, maintainable code, and building systems that make sense long-term. Whether I'm developing a mobile app, a web platform, or an AI model, I focus on clarity, simplicity, and user-centered design.`,
  whatDrivesMe: `I'm motivated by the challenge of turning real problems into practical tools — especially in areas like finance, education, productivity, and intelligent automation. I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting, and pushing myself to build products that create measurable impact.`,
  beyondCode: `Outside development, you'll find me exploring emerging tech, gaming, or brainstorming new product ideas. I enjoy environments where creativity and logic meet, and I'm always looking for ways to grow both as a developer and as a thinker.`,
  futureGoals: `My long-term goal is to grow into a strong full-stack and AI engineer capable of designing scalable, intelligent systems that serve real users and solve meaningful problems.`,
